	Its the train to Terra Base. Several passengers are in the car, young bussiness men and women pack the car. A scruffy looking youth sits across from you, he is wearing a leather overcoat and large cowboy boots. The telescreen is showing various adverts. The car doors are safely shut.

	The youth has tusseled sandy blond hair and a silly grin crosses his face. His leather over coat looks dusty, it has Tex stiched on the top left side, his cowboy boots has real spurs on. A large duffel bag is slung over his shoulder.
